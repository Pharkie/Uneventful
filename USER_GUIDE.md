# Unplanr - User Guide

## What is Unplanr?

Unplanr helps you bulk delete Google Calendar events. Instead of clicking through events one-by-one in Google Calendar, you can select multiple events and delete them all at once.

## How to Use

1. **Visit:** [unplanr.com](https://unplanr.com)
2. **Sign in** with your Google account
3. **Select calendars** - Click the colored calendar chips to show/hide events from each calendar (you can select multiple!)
4. **Filter events** - Use date range presets or search to narrow down
5. **Select events** - Click events or use "Select All" to mark events for deletion (X icons indicate selection)
6. **Click** "Delete X events" button
7. **Confirm** the permanent deletion
8. **Done!** Your events are removed

## Interface Tips

- **Calendar chips** show event counts when selected (e.g., "Work (12 events)")
- **Primary calendar** always appears first in the list
- **Colored left border** on each event shows which calendar it belongs to
- **X icons** are used throughout to reinforce delete intent
- **Select All** shows a minus (-) for partial selection, X for all selected

## Privacy & Security

- **Minimal permissions:** We only request access to view and edit calendar events (not calendar settings or other Google data)
- **No data storage:** Your credentials and calendar data are NEVER stored on our servers
- **Secure authentication:** Uses industry-standard OAuth 2.0 and JWT tokens
- **Encrypted:** All data transfer is encrypted via HTTPS
- **Open source:** Code is publicly available on GitHub for transparency
- **Your data stays yours:** We can't see your events - everything happens between you and Google

## Limitations

- Maximum 100 events per deletion (to stay within free hosting limits)
- Only works with Google Calendar
- Requires Google account sign-in
